# Draggable table with undo / redo operations

## How to Run

1. **Open the HTML file in VS Code**.
2. **Install the Live Server extension** in VS Code if you haven't already.
3. **Right-click the HTML file** and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

### Why Live Server?
The JavaScript in this project is modular, and the Live Server extension allows the browser to correctly handle and load the modules. Without it, modules might not work as expected due to browser restrictions.
